# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## What I Did

In this assignment:
* Non-semantic tags were adjusted to read semantically, while making sure that the web page will still run as intended. 
* Comments were added to the code to note where those changes have been made. 
* Classes were also changed to read semantically, and the CSS code was updated to match the classes and tags that were changed in the HTML code. 
* Comments were also added to the CSS code to describe which sections will format what portions of the web page, for reference.
* The title of the page was changed to be more descriptive.
